     <h5>Vegetable Samosa with green chutney</h5>
<p>Serve up these crisp vegan samosas as a tasty starter or side dish with your favourite curry.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul> <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 potato (about 150g) finely diced</li>
<li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
<li>100g frozen peas</li>
<li>2 tsp curry powder or your own spices according to taste</li>
<h3>For the pastry</h3>
<li>225g plain flour</li>
<li>2 tsp sea salt</li>
<li>2 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
<li>2l vegetable oil to deep fry</li></ul>
<h2>Method</h2>
<h4>STEP 1</h4>
<p>To make the filling, heat the oil in a frying pan, add the onion and garlic, mix in the spices and fry for 10 mins until soft. Add the vegetables, seasoning and stir well until coated. Leave to cool.
</p>
<h4>STEP 2</h4>
<p>To make the pastry, mix flour and salt into a bowl. Make a well in the centre, add the oil and 100ml water to make a firm dough. Knead the dough on a floured surface for 5-10 mins until smooth and roll into a ball. Cover in cling film and set aside at room temperature for 30 mins.</p>
<h4>STEP 3</h4>
<p>Divide the pastry into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and roll out into a circle of 15cm. Divide this circle into two equal pieces with a knife.</p>
<h4>STEP 4</h4>
<p>Brush each edge with a little water and form a cone shape around your fingers, sealing the dampened edge. Fill with 1 tbsp mixture and press the two dampened edges together to seal the top of the cone. Repeat with the remaining pastry.</p>
<h4>STEP 5</h4>
<p>Heat the oil in a large deep saucepan to 180C. The oil should come 1/3rd of the way up the pan. Deep fry the samosas in batches for 8-10 mins until crisp and brown. Take out and drain on kitchen paper.</p>
